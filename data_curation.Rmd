The following obtains the raw sequences from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and renames the fastq files. The file sra_to_samples.txt has the accession numbers (after fastq-dump) and identifiers of the paired reads from each sample. The identifiers followe the format <SampleName>_<SampleNumber>_L001_<ReadNumber>_001.fastq and were the ones used in the study. The mapping_file.txt associates the sample ID to the metadata.

Demultiplexing was done automatically using the onboard PC of the Miseq instrument and sequences represent only biological data (i.e. do not contain adapters or primers sequences). 

After retrieving and renaming the fastq files, the raw files will be located in the fastq_files directory.

```{r, engine='bash', results='hide'}
# download raw sequences from SRA
mkdir sra_files

for ((i=6865; i<=7016; i++))
  do
  sratoolkit.2.10.8-mac64/bin/prefetch SRR1251$i -O sra_files
done

mv sra_files/*/*.sra ./
rm -rf sra_files/

# convert SRA files into fastq format
for sra in *.sra
do
  sratoolkit.2.10.8-mac64/bin/fastq-dump --split-files "$sra" 
done

rm -f *.sra

# rename files from SRA format to Illumina Miseq format
while read sra new
do
    for srafile in $sra*
    do
        newfile="$new"
        mv "$srafile" "$newfile" 
    done
done < sra_to_fastq.txt

mkdir fastq_files
mv *.fastq fastq_files
